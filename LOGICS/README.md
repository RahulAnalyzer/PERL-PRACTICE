# LOGICS - Algorithms and Data Manipulation

This directory contains Perl scripts solving various algorithmic problems, including string manipulation, array rotation, and mathematical calculations.

## Files

### `ArrayString_Plaindrom.pl`
Checks if each string in a list is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

### `Array_roatation2.pl`
Rotates an array by `k` positions using a shifting method (element-by-element move).

### `Array_rotation1.pl`
Rotates an array by `k` positions using the reversal algorithm (reversing parts of the array).

### `Missing_number.pl`
Finds the missing number in a contiguous sequence of integers using the sum formula `N * (N + 1) / 2`.

### `VowelCount.pl`
A multi-purpose script that:
- Counts vowels and consonants in a list of names.
- Counts character occurrences in a name.
- Reverses a string using different methods.
- Checks if a string is a palindrome.

### `find_common_str.pl`
Identifies and prints common elements between two arrays using a hash for efficient lookup.

### `keypad.pl`
Simulates an old mobile keypad input system. Converts a given word into the sequence of key presses required to type it (e.g., 'a' -> 2, 'b' -> 22).

### `logic.pl`
Performs text processing tasks on a sample text:
- Counts non-empty lines.
- Searches for a specific word.
- Counts unique words (case-insensitive).
- Counts total characters.
